# What Does a Software Engineer Do?
*(https://www.coursera.org/articles/software-engineer)

### This article is about software engineering in general. It compares the system developers with application developers. I like this article because it talks in depth about the career paths in software engineering and the ways to become a software engineer.


## Comment by Dixit Timilsina:
#### I liked how the article compares and contrasts system developers with application developers although both are known as software engineers.
